## Requirements

- **Hugo version 0.87.0 or higher**   
To check your installed version, run:   
  ```bash
  hugo version
  ```
  If Hugo is not installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for installation.


## Quick Start 

1. Create a new Hugo site:  

    ```bash
    hugo new site my-site --format="yaml"
    ```  
    This uses a `hugo.yaml` configuration file instead of the default TOML format. 

2. Add a theme.  

    Option A: Clone this repository inside your themes folder.  
    This allows you to make lots of custom changes.
    ```bash
    cd my-site/themes
    git clone https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git
    ```

    Option B: Add as a Git submodule.  
    This allows you to get automatic or structured updates from the original repository.

    ```bash
    cd my-site
    git init
    git submodule add https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile.git themes/hugo-profile
    ```    

3. Copy the example configuration file to your site root:
    ```bash
    cp -f themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/hugo.yaml ./hugo.yaml
    ```

4. Start the Hugo development server:
    ```bash
    hugo server
    ```
5. Recommended: Copy example content and assets.

    When you first run `hugo server`, the site may look incomplete ‚Äî images may be missing and the Blog or Gallery sections might not appear.  

    This is because their content currently resides in `themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/`, whereas Hugo expects them in the root-level `static/` (for images) and `content/` (for pages) directories.

    To have a complete view of the example site, run:  

    ```bash
    rsync -av themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/static/ ./static/
    rsync -av themes/hugo-profile/exampleSite/content/ ./content/
    ```

    You can customize or replace this content to match your own site.


## Content Management

You can now start customizing your site.

To change the site title or homepage content, edit the `hugo.yaml` file in the root directory. This file also controls settings for showing or hiding sections of the site (e.g., About, Education).

To create a new page, for example, in the Blog section, run:

```bash
hugo new content content/blogs/my-post.md
```

This creates a new file in the `content/blogs/` folder with front matter that includes metadata like the date.

* [Wiki Page](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile/wiki) ‚Äì Tips specific to this theme.


## Deployment

If you do not require extensive customization, the easiest way to deploy is:
1. Click the **Use this template** button to create your own repository.
2. Connect the repository to **Netlify**.

Whenever you make changes to the files inside the `exampleSite` folder, Netlify will automatically detect and deploy your changes. 

---


If you followed the steps in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section above, you can still deploy your site to Netlify, but you'll need a few additional configurations.   

See the **[Host on Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/)** guide for further information.

---

For manual deployment, run `hugo` to generate the final, ready-to-deploy static site in the `public/` folder, which you can upload to any hosting platform.

It is recommended to delete the `public/` folder before each build to ensure it only contains the latest output:

```bash
rm -rf public/ && hugo
```


## Trouble-Shooting

```
ERROR error calling resources.GetRemote: Get "https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?dnt=false&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FGoHugoIO%2Fstatus%2F1315233626070503424": net/http: TLS handshake timeout
Built in 10266 ms
Error: error building site: logged 1 error(s)
```
The TLS handshake timeout error can happen due to network issues. If this error persists, you can delete the shortcode example `{{< tweet user="GoHugoIO" id="1315233626070503424" >}}` in the "content/blogs/rich-content.md" file.
